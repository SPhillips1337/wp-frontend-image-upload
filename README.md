Introduction
============
I had an idea a while ago to make a HTML 5 frontend image upload plugin for Wordpress which worked with mobiles to show the preview etc when taking photos with a camera, Which I hope this will be the start of.

This is an example of a functioning plugin which will allow you to place an image upload form on any page in Wordpress using a shortcode of '[frontend_image_uploader]' which will all a user to upload an image directly into the Wordpress media library from the front end.

There is currently no admin options or anything for this but I hope to develop this plugin further.

Notes
=====
I followed several guides in creating this plugin which can be found below for reference;
